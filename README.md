# Javascript

This repository is my personal space for learning JavaScript.  
I am following **Chai aur Code's Chai aur JS series on YouTube** and using this repo to practice concepts, write example code, and track my progress.

The code here is mainly for self-reference and revision as I improve my JS skills.
